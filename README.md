# TELCO ANALYSIS

## Introduction
Your employer wants you to provide a report to analyse opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  You will do this by analysing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network. You will deliver insights you managed to extract to your employer through an easy to use web based dashboard and a written report.
